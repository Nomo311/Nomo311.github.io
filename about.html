                <h1>Hello</h1>
                <p>
                    My name is Ryan Eugene Cooper. I am a writer, web developer, and game designer.
                </p>    
                <h1>Skills and Education</h1>
                <p>
                    I was born and raised in Gary, IN before moving to Vincennes, IN and obtaining my associate degree in IT. I later moved to Indianapolis, IN to further my education and am now currently attending IUPUI, majoring in the Foundations of New Media. 
                </p>
                <p>    
                    I have learned and studied multiple programming languages such as Python primarily, HTML, GML, and C++. I have also worked with multiple game engines. From Unity to Unreal Engine, to Game Maker Studio 2, and now Godot. In my free time, outside of university, I have bought and indulged myself in online courses from multiple sources such as GameDev, Zenva, and Skillshare.
                </p>  
                <h1>Aspirations</h1>
                <p>
                    I fell in love with video games at an early age. I didn’t know much at the time, but I knew I wanted to both replicate and share that sense of freedom I felt when I was young. Growing older, I learned that very freedom was a feeling guided by imagination, held aloft by purpose. So, over the years, I’ve made a point to be in the same way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My curious mind has tip-toed me into multiple mediums; video games, creative storytelling, 2D and 3D art, music, etc. Eventually, a fascination grew until I found myself learning all of it. Many may describe that as overly ambitious, if not a tad naïve, but I can aptly express my ideals in one way: greedy. Because not only do I want to learn all these lovely forms of expression, but I also want to see that expression in others through the games and experiences I create. I want to be guided by my imagination, and with the purpose of growing insurmountably.
