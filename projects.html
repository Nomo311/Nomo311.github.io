            This render came from a course I was able to purchase from GameDev
            with the help of Humble Bundle. After getting their students
            familiar with the fundementals of Blender, the course walks students
            through the process of changing materials, lighting, and various
            other visual effects.

          <h2>Return: NuLL</h2>
          <h3>GameMaker 2 Project</h3>
          <p>
            A couple years after getting my degree in IT, I decided to make an
            attempt at creating something tangible. Ideally, something that I
            could use to evaluate myself on creating mechanics that are fun and
            engaging. Project Null is the result of that, having a turn-based
            system inspired by the gameplay loop of Dark Souls 1.

          <h2>Sprite Work</h2>
          <h3>Side Project</h3>
          <p>
            Perhaps I was ahead of myself at the time, but after finding some
            ground with Null, I had the idea of making a character creator. My
            method was to use a style that was both simple and familiar as a way
            to learn more fluently, and that style ending up being Pok√©mon
            sprites from their Gen 3 & 4 games.

            I am curently working on multiple stories at the moment in my free
            time. With Google Doc however, I am able to convey said stories
            along with their corresponding themes in a way that doesn't reveal
            too much.
