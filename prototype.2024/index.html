              I developed the framework for my senior capstone “The Magic City
              Beats,” a game concept heavily inspired by the Castlevania series,
              but with a stronger focus on platforming, tight controls, and
              minimalist yet stylish combat mechanics. My intention for this
              project was to not just create a game that players could only wish
              was fully complete, but to also be the best project presented at
              my senior capstone, and undisputably so. This project was created
              using Game Maker Studio 2 alongside Microsoft Paint for the
              development and the sprite work respectively. And this demo
              version of my capstone acts as the progenitor, benchmark, and
              guideline for the rest of development moving forward. Ultimately,
              Magic City Beats will display all of what I’ve learned throughout
              my academic career; game design, storytelling, art, and music,
              while also doubling as a love letter to my hometown, Gary, IN. In
              short, I expect it to be my magnum opus.
