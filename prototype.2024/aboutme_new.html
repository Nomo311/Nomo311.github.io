        <h1>Who is Ryan Cooper?</h1>
        <h3>Game Desgner and Developer</h3>
        <p>Greetings. My name is Ryan E. Cooper. I’m a Game Designer who specializes in Mechanical and Narrative Storytelling through worldbuilding. However, I am also a learned Web Developer, Pixel Artist, 3D Animator, and Project Manager.</p>
        <p>I was born in the humble city of Gary, Indiana. I then moved to Vincennes, IN to obtain my associate’s degree in Information Technology, and later moved to Indianapolis, IN for my bachelor’s degree in Media Arts and Science. Though I was raised on very little, I grew up with things that I found were larger than life; my family, my friends, and gaming. How video games capture and solidify worlds into experience is something that will always mesmerizing, and it is a feeling I would like to replicate and share with others.  </p>
