        <h1>Ryan Cooper</h1>
        <h3>Game Designer and Developer</h3>
        <p>
          Greetings. My name is Ryan E. Cooper. I’m a Game Designer who
          specializes in Mechanical and Narrative Storytelling via
          worldbuilding. However, I am also a learned Web Developer, Pixel
          Artist, 3D Animator, and Project Manager.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was born in the humble city of Gary, Indiana. I then moved to
          Vincennes, IN to obtain my associate’s degree in Information
          Technology, and later moved to Indianapolis, IN for my bachelor’s
          degree in Media Arts and Science. Though I was raised on very little,
          I grew up with things that I found were larger than life; my family,
          my friends, and gaming. How video games capture and solidify worlds
          into experience is something that will always mesmerizing, and it is a
          feeling I would like to replicate and share with others.
