                I developed the framework for my senior capstone “The Magic City
                Beats,” a game concept heavily inspired by the Castlevania
                series, but with a stronger focus on platforming, tight
                controls, and minimalist yet stylish combat mechanics...

              <h1>Supermoon 64</h1>
              <p>
                I co-developed an on-rails shooter by the name of “Supermoon
                64,” which took the player through a world of over-the-top
                concepts and nonsensical humor as a way to both have a laugh at,
                and have a laugh with, the tropes this project pays homage to.
                Such tropes involve concepts popularized in Japanese media as
                well as the American appropriation of said tropes via ‘Mary
                Sues.’ I was responsible for the user interface of this project,
                as well as the sound design, player models, and game-narrative.
                The project was created in Unity, but the 3D models were made in
                Blender and the majority of the UI and heads up display, or HUD,
                was made in Microsoft Paint. This project was my first
                introduction to the practical reality of game development within
                a group and sharing responsibilities for the overall quality of
                a project. And ultimately, this project expresses my skills to
                thoroughly have enjoyment in building around such a concept as
                ‘joy’ and ‘passion’ are what retains a game’s integrity
                throughout its development.

              <h1>Journey in a Bottle</h1>
              <p>
                I created a story-focused video essay for the indie game, Salt
                and Sanctuary, titled “Journey in a Bottle”. This project
                consisted of recording a considerably sizeable amount of footage
                before syphoning through 200 GBs worth of recordings and then
                organizing it in a cohesive and coherent end-product. The video
                essay was made by using OBS Studios for the recording aspect and
                Vegas Pro 18 for the editing. While Journey in a Bottle was a
                personal project, it had proved my practical skills of being
                able to thoroughly comprehend the entirety of a game’s world and
                narrative, and then be able to express said world and narrative
                toward a large group of people. This is a particularly useful
                skill as a designer who focuses on game mechanics and narrative
                through game mechanics, as well as an aspiring project lead who
                needs to convey the tone and story of a project to their team.

              <h1>Sun Lighter - 3D Animation</h1>
              <p>
                I created a spaceship animation using Maya Autodesk. When
                creating this project, nothing at first felt as if it was
                thinking outside the box. However, like many, I was captivated
                by the 2023 Full Eclipse in Indiana. Though it was impossible to
                replicate such a phenomena, I was obsessed with reflecting at
                least a fraction of its majesty.
