              I developed the framework for my senior capstone “The Magic City
              Beats,” a game concept heavily inspired by the Castlevania series,
              but with a stronger focus on platforming, tight controls, and
              minimalist yet stylish combat mechanics. My intention for this
              project was to not just create a game that players could only wish
              was fully complete, but to also be the best project presented at
              my senior capstone, and undisputably so. This project was created
              using Game Maker Studio 2 alongside Microsoft Paint for the
              development and the sprite work respectively. And this demo
              version of my capstone acts as the progenitor, benchmark, and
              guideline for the rest of development moving forward. Ultimately,
              Magic City Beats will display all of what I’ve learned throughout
              my academic career; game design, storytelling, art, and music,
              while also doubling as a love letter to my hometown, Gary, IN. In
              short, I expect it to be my magnum opus.

              I co-developed an on-rails shooter by the name of “Supermoon 64,”
              which took the player through a world of over-the-top concepts and
              nonsensical humor as a way to both have a laugh at, and have a
              laugh with, the tropes this project pays homage to. Such tropes
              involve concepts popularized in Japanese media as well as the
              American appropriation of said tropes via ‘Mary Sues.’ I was
              responsible for the user interface of this project, as well as the
              sound design, player models, and game-narrative. The project was
              created in Unity, but the 3D models were made in Blender and the
              majority of the UI and heads up display, or HUD, was made in
              Microsoft Paint. This project was my first introduction to the
              practical reality of game development within a group and sharing
              responsibilities for the overall quality of a project. And
              ultimately, this project expresses my skills to thoroughly have
              enjoyment in building around such a concept as ‘joy’ and ‘passion’
              are what retains a game’s integrity throughout its development.

              I created a story-focused video essay for the indie game, Salt and
              Sanctuary, titled “Journey in a Bottle”. This project consisted of
              recording a considerably sizeable amount of footage before
              syphoning through 200 GBs worth of recordings and then organizing
              it in a cohesive and coherent end-product. The video essay was
              made by using OBS Studios for the recording aspect and Vegas Pro
              18 for the editing. While Journey in a Bottle was a personal
              project, it had proved my practical skills of being able to
              thoroughly comprehend the entirety of a game’s world and
              narrative, and then be able to express said world and narrative
              toward a large group of people. This is a particularly useful
              skill as a designer who focuses on game mechanics and narrative
              through game mechanics, as well as an aspiring project lead who
              needs to convey the tone and story of a project to their team.

              I designed and programmed a gallery of all my prominent artwork,
              ranging from 2D Illustrations to Pixel Animations and 3D
              Animations. As an undergraduate of Media Arts and Science with a
              specialization in game design and development, I thought it would
              be beneficial to have a gallery of my skills outside of my main
              focus to quickly express said skills in an unintrusive manner and
              be displayed without cluttering the rest of my portfolio. The art
              displayed ranges from multiple projects as well as left over
              concept ideas that would not have seen the light of day otherwise.
              As with my portfolio itself, the gallery is displayed in order by
              relevance and category using HTML 5 programming, but the software
              used for the artwork ranges from MS Paint, Aseprite, Photoshop,
              Maya, Blender, and FL Studio. To reiterate, this gallery is a
              concise showcase of my secondary skills as a Bachelor of Science.
